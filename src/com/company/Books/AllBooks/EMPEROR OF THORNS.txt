Mark Lawrence
The path to the throne is broken - only the broken can walk it. The world is cracked and time has run through, leaving us clutching at the end of days. These are the days that have waited for us all our lives. These are my days. I will stand before the Hundred and they will listen. I will take the throne no matter who stands against me, living or dead, and if I must mbe tge last emperor then I will make it such an ending.
